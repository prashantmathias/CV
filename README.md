## Prashant Mathias

A highly­ versatile Audio Engineer turned Web Developer. After several years of trying to learn programming on my own while working in the music and film industry in Los Angeles and Bangalore, I decided to join the highly intensive web development course at Makers Academy. This has structured learning has helped improve my programming skills by leaps and bounds and I now look forward to entering the exciting world of professional web development.

Committed to excellence, it has been my personal goal to fully grasp the vision of each client and bring it to life. Adept at delivering under stressful deadlines to difficult clients, my patience and understanding are tools I always carry with me. Personally driven by challenges and my love of gathering new skills, I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge.

## Strengths

#### Teamwork
Having worked in big teams on a multitude of projects as an Audio Engineer and at Makers Academy, I have learned to keep my ego at the
door and my naturally patient and easy-going nature allows me to approach every professional situation with an open mind.

#### Problem-solving
For our final project at Makers Academy, my team and I decided to create a mobile app for both iOS and Android, to achieve which, we decided to learn NativeScript from scratch. Further, the version of NativeScript we used was newly released with not much documentation, forcing us to solve many problems without support. In the end, we managed to overcome all the challenges one at a time and see the app through to our satisfaction.

#### Passion for growth
I enjoy the challenge of using a new method or tool that requires me to leave my comfort zone. As an Audio Engineer I've had to understand and apply new technologies on tight turnaround projects without compromising the quality of deliveries, which was demanding and exciting.
